# Football-Hangman-Game
This is a hangman game I am creating for my pre-work at Coding House. I feel like this could be fun I
will add hints such as: Nationality, Birth place, Club etc. Feel free to contribute.

rules (for now):
  - Use jQuery and Bootstrap, for everything
  - Hard code a big array of 100+ source words in your javascript, and pick a word randomly from that.
  - Take the input directly from the user keyboard, and report it (used characters so far, wrong ones, ..) Don't take any input from the mouse.
  - If the user pressed a key for a character that has already been used, blink the screen
  - Use a library to add some cool animation when you win/lose the game.
